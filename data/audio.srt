1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
In the year of elections, two of Europe's three largest economies are heading to the

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,840
polls and investors' reactions couldn't be any more different.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,880
France's upcoming parliamentary elections are wreaking havoc on French stocks and bonds,

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,720
while UK financial markets have been relatively stable as the country gears up for its own

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,800
general election on July 4.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
So what are the markets telling us about the political landscape, and are there risks that

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,560
are being mispriced?

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,400
I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,280
price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,280
I'm Alison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,760
For today's episode, I'm sitting down with my colleagues in Goldman Sachs Research.

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,160
Sharon Bell is a senior strategist on the European Portfolio Strategy team and George

13
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,960
Cole is the head of European Rate Strategy in the Global Macro and Markets Research Group.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,200
They're both joining me remotely from London.

15
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,360
Sharon, George, welcome back to the program.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Great to see you all.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
Thank you.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
Thanks very much.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,840
So let's start with the French elections.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,840
The snap election called by French President Emmanuel Macron, which will take place on

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
June 30 with a second round on July 7, was no doubt a surprise.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,800
And I'm not saying it wasn't, but it sent French assets into an absolute tailspin.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,560
Sharon, why do the markets react so strongly?

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,680
You know, I think that there are lots of reasons.

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,760
I mean, I probably put them down into four different buckets.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,560
One is the first one, which you've already covered, which was a surprise.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,520
We've had lots of elections this year, but this one wasn't expected, first of all.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,160
Secondly, the outcome of this election looks quite uncertain and markets hate uncertain.

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,080
So I think that's important as well.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,040
But probably thirdly and most importantly, the debt situation in France is pretty worrisome

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,320
and debt to GDP ratio of over 110% and quite a large deficit as well.

32
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,400
And the concern is that you will see more fiscal slippage.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,960
You will not get a coordinated government that will bring that deficit and debt level

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,960
down over time.

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,260
So that's a big concern.

36
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,360
And then finally, with my equity hat on, I would say that some of the policies, particularly

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,720
the far left and the far right parties in France, would hit company earnings.

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,700
Discussions of things like, say, potential windfall taxes, for example.

39
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,180
So there are lots of reasons and really, though, the market hates uncertainty.

40
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,660
And is there an election outcome that the markets are most concerned about?

41
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,500
I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to

42
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,160
price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,820
The one that they would like most of all, I believe, is the status quo we've currently

44
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,820
got.

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,740
The current sort of government is planning to reduce the deficit in France.

46
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,540
And we did have eventually debt to GDP in France peaking and coming down.

47
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,580
The other potential outcomes that we might get, for example, a minority far right government

48
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,740
or a majority far right government, either of those are much less likely to bring down

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,920
that debt ratio in France.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,140
So there isn't really an outcome that markets are looking at that says, yeah, this is much

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,780
better than we expected.

52
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,580
And I think even the outcome that we do get over the next few weeks, if it's a minority

53
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,340
government or no coalition is formed, you might have further elections only a few months

54
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
away.

55
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,620
So again, that adds an extra layer of uncertainty for markets.

56
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,340
In the volatility that we've observed so far, which assets have moved the most?

57
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,620
So if I look, and again, I'm going to focus on equities here, and George can talk a bit

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
more about rates.

59
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,780
But if I look at the French equity market overall, the gains that we saw this year were

60
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,100
wiped out, really in very little time.

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,660
We've seen double digit falls for things like the French small cap indices, domestic stocks

62
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,500
in France, banks, and we've also seen sharp falls of infrastructure companies, which tend

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,740
to be quite defensive stocks in France too.

64
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,300
I mean, European equities, they have had a bit of a setback and particularly relative

65
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
to the S&P.

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,300
So if I look relative to the S&P 500, the stock 600, which is a broad measure of the

67
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,620
European market, that's down 5% relative to the US market in the last couple of weeks.

68
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,460
The impact on global equities though has been quite tiny.

69
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,340
So I do think this is seen as more a French issue first, and then a European issue second.

70
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,100
Well, as you said, though, the European equities have been hit a bit.

71
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,820
Do you think the markets broadly are overreacting when you think about the moves we've seen

72
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,540
in European equities and then even in French equities?

73
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,340
Yeah, it's a good question, given that the moves that we've had.

74
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,060
So for the CAC40 companies, which is the blue tip index in France, the actual exposure

75
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,380
to France in terms of sales for those stocks is quite small.

76
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,820
It's about 15% of their sales exposure.

77
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,180
I sometimes think it works better to flip it the other way around and think that 85%

78
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,600
of these companies' exposures is outside of France itself.

79
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,860
So arguably the moves, which we've seen year to date, wiping out the progress that the

80
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,700
CAC40 had made, does seem quite harsh relative to the fact this is a very international index.

81
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,540
But that being said, I do think the uncertainty is extremely high.

82
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,840
Investors are nervous.

83
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,460
And the CAC40 had been a good performer in recent years with a relatively high valuation.

84
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,600
So given all of that, I don't think the market move is all that extreme.

85
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,300
I think there's been pockets that might have been a bit extreme relative to, say, direct

86
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,500
earnings impact.

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,700
But given the sort of higher risk premium that we now have, I'm not surprised to see

88
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,180
this type of move.

89
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,180
Interesting.

90
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,340
And George, if we look at the bond market, French 10-year government bond yields have

91
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,240
surged relative to German bonds to the widest levels we've seen in recent years.

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,400
So what are the markets, the bond markets telling us about this situation?

93
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,920
We do know that the European bond markets price in relative credit worthiness via these

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
credit spreads.

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,980
So the level of yields typically benchmarked against the strongest credit, Germany, give

96
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:02,420
you some sense about the market's concern about the ability to finance future debt,

97
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,620
confidence in future fiscal trajectories, and so on.

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,460
And they move around with the fundamentals.

99
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,460
So if growth is weaker or government plans to spend more, you typically find these credit

100
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,460
spreads widening.

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,140
Now, what we've seen is about a 30 basis point, maybe depending on the day, maybe slightly

102
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,980
more credit spread widening between France and Germany.

103
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,700
That sounds maybe small relative to the sort of credit spread widening we've seen in other

104
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,760
European markets over the several years.

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,060
But this really is quite a big move for France.

106
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,540
It's akin to the move we saw ahead of the 2017 French presidential election, which again

107
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,720
was a fairly notable widening.

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,740
And so what it is really telling us is that the market is concerned that ultimately either

109
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,340
because of a general rise in the level of uncertainty about any future government's

110
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:58,260
capacity to improve the fiscal path or the possibility of electoral outcomes where you

111
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:04,940
have significant spending that is on top of the current fiscal trajectory, which as Sharon

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,900
mentioned is already a source of some concern for markets.

113
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,620
That really has left us in a fairly net negative position.

114
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,420
We either learn that spreads probably struggle to recover the levels we saw before the European

115
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,220
simply because the outcome worsens for the French president Macron, even in perhaps a

116
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,500
situation of a hung parliament, for example, if he had a diminished relative majority.

117
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,620
Or we learn that actually a government comes in with a more expansionary fiscal program.

118
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,740
And so the market is wrestling with that risk.

119
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,960
It's also interesting to note we've seen a bid for German bonds.

120
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,940
And so it's not just been a rise in French yields.

121
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,340
What we've also seen is that spread has widened because German yields have fallen.

122
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,340
And although French yields have been creeping back up, that actually tempers the overall

123
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,940
yield move for French bonds because ultimately the credit spread can widen not only because

124
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,040
French yields go up, but German yields go down and actually insulate the overall level

125
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,840
of yields in France.

126
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,400
And George, you said that there's actually a bid for German bonds, flight to safety, I assume.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,760
Are there other assets that are particularly vulnerable or going to benefit in the bond market?

128
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,480
Yeah, well, I think that this is really the key thing that we are looking out for is the

129
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,900
extent to which stresses or repricing of credit spreads in France spills over into other markets.

130
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:39,600
We've seen in previous episodes, of course, you know, generalized spread moves in Europe,

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,220
for example, think about Italy and Spain and Portugal.

132
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,540
When you see, you know, a weakening of credit spread in one market, you often find that

133
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,680
there are spillovers to the other markets.

134
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,020
And so that is a key thing that the market is, you know, really got its eye on.

135
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,740
The world does look a little bit different to where we were perhaps a decade or so ago.

136
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:06,860
We now have additional measures, for example, at the ECB or the EU wide level that reduce

137
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,940
tail risk.

138
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,400
The ECB has its transmission protection instrument, which is a kind of backstop facility to buy

139
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,860
bonds if stresses emerge.

140
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:21,720
We know that at the EU level, there are additional fiscal pooling measures through the recovery

141
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,280
fund that supports Southern European economies.

142
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,880
And so in that sense, we perhaps don't have the same vulnerabilities as in the past.

143
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,880
However, we do have a situation where if there is a substantial challenge to, you know, fiscal

144
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,420
discipline coming out of the next French government, there is maybe the potential for that to have

145
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,400
knock on effects to other economies.

146
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,360
So what we are noticing is that although we are looking at the move in French bonds as

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,000
probably being reasonably large, given the potential for the next government to undertake

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,740
an expansionary fiscal plan, it does look like the market is still quite calm about

149
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,100
the implications for other economies.

150
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,860
It's not clear that that is wrong, but it's also something that makes us a little bit

151
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,680
wary about stepping in, for example, to buy these other markets just here.

152
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
Right.

153
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,220
So it's not clear that the market is right, is I think what I'm hearing you say.

154
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,080
But if we take a step back for a moment, I recall heading into this year, there was so

155
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,420
much focus on how expensive the U.S. market had gotten after a period of U.S. exceptionalism

156
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:37,420
for several years and growing optimism that the investment flows into the U.S. would start

157
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,140
to redirect towards areas elsewhere, such as Europe.

158
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,580
Has this ongoing political uncertainty in a core member like France upended that narrative?

159
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,800
Yeah, this is a great question and a real problem for Europe.

160
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,980
If we go about the clock about a month ago, I think the main conversation I was having

161
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:00,620
with global investors was the concern that, although yes, absolutely, the U.S. has got

162
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,780
its exceptionalism, you're already well pricing that in the case of the U.S.

163
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:10,140
So the S&P was very expensive and the MAG7 in the U.S. are such a dominant part of the

164
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,580
index, you're very concentrated in your exposure if you're investing in the U.S.

165
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,860
So there was a kind of view that, well, maybe we should look at Europe.

166
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,180
And they looked at Europe and they found that activity was improving, interest rates were

167
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,820
coming down in front of the Fed, very helpful, and that valuations were a lot lower.

168
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,820
And although the European equity market is quite concentrated too, it's not as concentrated

169
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,860
as in the U.S. and not in just that one sector either.

170
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,540
So tick, tick, tick, you've found that Europe offered some value and some cyclical improvement.

171
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,460
I still think it does, but I think this is obviously added to uncertainty.

172
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,060
And really, if I look at investment flows in Europe, in the last two years, we have

173
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,420
had constant outflows from global investors into Europe.

174
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,220
Really, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, we've seen those consistent outflows.

175
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,620
And they were starting to come back in, as I said, in that month or so, you were starting

176
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,540
to see investors interest in Europe for those elements I mentioned before.

177
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,220
But this really has shone a light, I would say, on the structural problems Europe has.

178
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,380
So the structural problems were always there, but you were willing to overlook them for

179
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,360
the cyclical upside I just mentioned.

180
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,140
The structural problems being a lack of growth, lack of productivity, lack of investment,

181
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,180
all of that I would put under the label of lack of growth.

182
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,440
And then the debt level that's already accumulated in Europe.

183
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,660
So those two problems, and I think those structural issues, which are very difficult to resolve,

184
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,300
this French election has really shone a light on those particular problematic issues.

185
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,820
And if we do see the outcome that the market fears, a far-right majority taking hold of

186
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,740
the government, and we see the fiscal expansion that the market is concerned about, that's

187
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,300
ultimately inflationary.

188
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,380
In which case, will that complicate the monetary policy mission going forward?

189
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Yeah.

190
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,180
So I think this is the really interesting issue for the European economies.

191
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:03,460
It can be very challenging to undertake a unilateral fiscal expansion that actually

192
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,300
does have the impact on growth and inflation that you want, right?

193
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
That you want this to be better for growth.

194
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,940
The reason is that credit spread.

195
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Because if that credit spread widens enough, then actually this is detrimental to growth.

196
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:24,060
We've got a situation where the market is worried about fiscal risks, and the net impact

197
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,180
for the economy may not be positive.

198
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,720
It may be that ultimately credit spreads or absolute yield levels rise so much that actually

199
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,300
it has a contractionary effect on the economy.

200
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Again, that may be not quite where we are.

201
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,420
However, that I think is the really important thing to remember.

202
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,020
The growth benefits from looser fiscal policy can be taken back by that widening in the

203
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
credit spread.

204
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:53,440
And that's why I think ultimately the ECB will be very, very focused on transmission.

205
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,340
Because ultimately, you're right, inflation is too high.

206
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:05,960
And if you were to see, for example, a cooperative, coordinated fiscal expansion at the EU level

207
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,720
or the area-wide level, that would be much more inflationary.

208
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,440
But if you saw one country unilaterally attempting to undertake a big fiscal expansion, that

209
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,320
actually could have the opposite effect if the financial conditions tightening via wider

210
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,280
spreads, undoes the impact of that better growth.

211
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:30,760
So I think it's a little more complicated than to say the impact would be net inflationary,

212
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,280
because ultimately the market will give you a signal about whether or not that fiscal

213
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,040
policy is tenable.

214
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,760
I think for that reason, it does suggest that the incentive for any incoming government,

215
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,500
even the absolute majority of National Rally, would be to moderate the fiscal program compared

216
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,240
to a situation that would see a very significant and negative market reaction.

217
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,320
But again, the market obviously has widened because it just doesn't know what is likely

218
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
to come next.

219
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,600
I think that's such a good point as well, because we've had some incarnations of populist

220
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,400
governments in the last few years that didn't turn out to be as negative for markets as

221
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
perhaps investors feared beforehand.

222
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,600
And of course, that is an upside risk here that you do see a majority or even a minority

223
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,880
government which is National Rally, and yet they're perhaps not as extreme in their policies

224
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,080
as many investors worry about.

225
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Interesting.

226
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,080
Let's turn to the UK election on July 4th, where the outcome seems potentially more certain

227
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,360
and markets have reacted less strongly.

228
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,440
Sharon, what issues are at stake there?

229
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Yeah, so for equities, the UK election I would say is less worrisome.

230
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,360
And I think less worrisome than what we've been talking about with respect to France

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,900
in two senses.

232
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,760
First of all, the polling data is pointing to a clear lead for the Labour Party.

233
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,980
So the outcome feels a lot less uncertain.

234
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:59,020
And the second is that the space for being radical on policy is much more limited as

235
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:03,940
both of the main parties in the UK, the current government under the Conservative Party, or

236
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,540
the Labour Party that is in the lead in the polls, both of them are promising to keep

237
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,260
within quite tight fiscal rules.

238
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,980
And given that, there isn't a lot of space for huge surprises of the nature that will

239
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,520
potentially spook the markets.

240
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,860
So I see it as much less of a risk event.

241
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,220
George, do you agree?

242
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,140
Yeah, I mean, I think that when we look at the macro implications for the various plausible

243
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,380
outcomes under the current party plans, we really don't get a particularly widespread

244
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,300
on things like growth, inflation, the deficit.

245
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,500
It's not as if there are no differences.

246
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,480
And perhaps you could imagine the market thinking and trying to price and understand, for example,

247
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
differences in the composition of the deficit.

248
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,980
Is it more taxation, more spending, or is it less on both?

249
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,060
Is the margin of the governing majority going to have some impact on the way that the market

250
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
reacts?

251
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:59,200
All of that is possible, but I think that's kind of second order to the point that Sharon

252
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,260
made that ultimately, it feels like the overall uncertainty around this election, not just

253
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,120
for the outcome itself, but the implications for macroeconomic policy on the far side is

254
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,220
likely to be a bit smaller this time.

255
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,840
But it always seems like as soon as we get comfortable about the amount of uncertainty

256
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,620
and assume something will be more certain, we're surprised.

257
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,620
And political uncertainty has, of course, been a key feature of the UK.

258
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,260
I'm thinking back to the 2022 LDI crisis, Brexit.

259
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:36,140
Still, maybe that was a moment where we expected some volatility and tremendous amount of uncertainty,

260
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,740
yet it was still somewhat of a shocker.

261
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:46,200
So are there any risks in the UK that are being mispriced or underestimated, George?

262
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,460
That's a really good question.

263
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,060
And I think that you're absolutely right in listing the events of the recent decade and

264
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,700
looking at the levels of uncertainty with a market pricing, you know, in terms of volatility

265
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:04,600
priced into markets, looking at the big shifts in asset pricing that we have seen.

266
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:11,200
Of course, that uncertainty has had huge impacts on UK markets, on sterling and on

267
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,920
the real economy itself.

268
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:20,700
I think in some sense, the freshness of the 2022 LDI crisis means I am more confident

269
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,840
to say that those risks have diminished simply because I do think, again, just having that

270
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,280
in the recent history itself constrains the kind of political possibilities in a way,

271
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,000
because the costs of that event were just so significant that ultimately it does push

272
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,880
toward more moderate policies.

273
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,220
And I think it has really made it clear that taking excessive fiscal risks is quite an

274
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,680
unwise thing to do.

275
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,040
Again, in the current moment when yields are high, inflation is high, the central banks,

276
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,440
you know, are finding it difficult to provide a lot of relief by cutting rates.

277
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,280
And so it's not to say, of course, that fiscal risks have disappeared.

278
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,480
They are still, of course, there for the UK, but it does look like, at least in terms

279
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,320
of the political consensus, it's moved to a much more moderate position.

280
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,400
Maybe I could mention one other thing, which is that we've very clearly seen the UK move

281
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,400
to a relatively hard form of Brexit, introducing a lot of friction with the trading relationship

282
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
with Europe.

283
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,020
I think it's interesting to consider the possibility that maybe that doesn't worsen from here and

284
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,920
in fact may even improve.

285
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,800
And so in a sense, could it be that the risk that is mispriced, could it be a positive

286
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
one?

287
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,140
I mean, that seems something that might seem a long shot and probably is a more long term

288
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,280
question for the UK given the current political reality.

289
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,100
But I think that the situation where the UK seeks to improve what has been a really poor

290
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,520
productivity performance by loosening the supply side of the economy, moving closer

291
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,400
to its nearest trading partner, not reversing Brexit necessarily, but maybe taking measures

292
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,560
to reduce trade frictions or enter into various reciprocal agreements.

293
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,440
And I would argue within equities that sort of upside risk, upside potential is not superpriced

294
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
either.

295
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,160
If I look at say, FTSE 100, the big cap index in the UK, it trades on roughly half the valuation

296
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,200
of the S&P and many would argue rightly so because it doesn't have the exposure to tech,

297
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
but it is one of the cheapest indices globally.

298
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,320
And if I look at say the FTSE 250, which is the mid cap index, which is much more UK exposed,

299
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,060
that is also trading on a similar valuation and it's close to the lows of its valuation

300
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,940
range in the last 20 years.

301
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,960
So this shows you the market's already pricing a lot of the weaker structural problems in

302
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,640
the UK and not so much of the potential upside risk that George talked about.

303
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,240
But it seems kind of ironic to me that just as the UK may be getting to a place where

304
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:52,420
it could start to strengthen its relationship with the euro area again, the euro area again

305
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,800
seems to be very much in question.

306
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,520
You know, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm hearing more and more concern about the fragmentation

307
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,880
of the euro area than I've heard in quite some time.

308
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,120
So as a leaving question, let me just ask you, what are you watching in terms of the

309
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,300
signs of growing risk in the euro area?

310
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,220
So very clearly, as I mentioned before, watching the credit spreads is a very clear way to

311
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,760
see is the market pricing this as a localised domestic issue for France or is it broadening

312
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,180
out and seeing spillovers into other sovereign markets and being priced as a more generalised,

313
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,600
if you like, systemic risk in Europe?

314
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,660
It's a reasonable question to ask.

315
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,900
You know, how can France have a serious issue, for example, around fiscal policy or credit

316
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,260
spreads without it being a European issue, just given how important France is to the

317
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,780
broader euro area and EU as a whole?

318
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,940
And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable point to make.

319
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:56,020
And so in a sense, I do think watching this relatively calm response that we've seen in

320
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,300
other sovereign bond markets is absolutely key.

321
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,940
To the extent that that begins to broaden out, it would be a sign that maybe the market

322
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,620
is starting to connect the dots and say that whether it's because of potential changes

323
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:16,320
to fiscal rules, whether it's because of potential implications for the 2027 presidential election

324
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,700
in France, there might be broader risks than just something you see on the French domestic

325
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,980
political front.

326
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,080
And then, of course, I do think for the broader economy, is this something that will be a

327
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,780
negative for French growth?

328
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,180
Will it be broader tightening in financial conditions that will weaken the economy?

329
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:40,520
Because what we do know is that euro area fragmentation risk, as you mentioned, we have

330
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,660
seen that that really comes to the fore when growth is particularly weak.

331
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,740
And at the moment, what we have seen is that there has been some signs of a cyclical upswing.

332
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,300
We know that the European consumer will benefit from lower inflation, lower energy prices.

333
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
That should be a tailwind to growth.

334
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,780
And if you were to see a financial conditions tightening, short circuit that and move the

335
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,340
euro area into a weaker period of growth, that, of course, increases those risks.

336
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,860
I would say that, again, and I think I mentioned earlier, the world is different post-pandemic.

337
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:17,800
We do have additional backstops in the euro area that curtail some of the fragmentation

338
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,300
risks that we've seen in the past.

339
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,740
Again, that might be one of the reasons why the market is a little more relaxed this time

340
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,900
beyond the French bond market.

341
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,500
But that, of course, bears close watching.

342
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,300
And I think what is clear is that we certainly haven't seen moves in sovereign bond markets

343
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,980
that would warrant some intervention with those backstops from the ECB.

344
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,940
That of course would be a lot further away in terms of spread widening.

345
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,540
So watch the outcome of the French election, of course.

346
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:51,480
Watch for any spillover risk into other regional bond markets and the economy more broadly.

347
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,340
And in the UK, let's see.

348
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,020
We'll see for another political surprise or if we and the markets are right that we're

349
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:02,820
going to have a more benign outcome and hopefully a bit more of a positive trajectory in terms

350
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,140
of the relationship between the UK and Europe.

351
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,220
And we'll see what it brings for the economy and markets.

352
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
Absolutely.

353
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,900
I think one thing I would say is just, you know, we're four for four for interesting

354
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,060
elections so far.

355
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,700
If you think across emerging markets, the EU election, which again threw up the surprise

356
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,700
of the French, and of course, we've got some big ones to come.

357
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,980
Sharon, George, thanks so much for joining us.
