0	4040	In the year of elections, two of Europe's three largest economies are heading to the
4040	7840	polls and investors' reactions couldn't be any more different.
7840	12880	France's upcoming parliamentary elections are wreaking havoc on French stocks and bonds,
12880	17720	while UK financial markets have been relatively stable as the country gears up for its own
17720	19800	general election on July 4.
19800	24200	So what are the markets telling us about the political landscape, and are there risks that
24200	25560	are being mispriced?
25560	29400	I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to
29400	35280	price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.
35280	38280	I'm Alison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges.
46720	50760	For today's episode, I'm sitting down with my colleagues in Goldman Sachs Research.
50760	55160	Sharon Bell is a senior strategist on the European Portfolio Strategy team and George
55160	59960	Cole is the head of European Rate Strategy in the Global Macro and Markets Research Group.
59960	62200	They're both joining me remotely from London.
62200	64360	Sharon, George, welcome back to the program.
64360	65360	Great to see you all.
65360	66360	Thank you.
66360	67360	Thanks very much.
67360	68840	So let's start with the French elections.
68840	73840	The snap election called by French President Emmanuel Macron, which will take place on
73840	78560	June 30 with a second round on July 7, was no doubt a surprise.
78560	83800	And I'm not saying it wasn't, but it sent French assets into an absolute tailspin.
83880	86560	Sharon, why do the markets react so strongly?
86560	88680	You know, I think that there are lots of reasons.
88680	91760	I mean, I probably put them down into four different buckets.
91760	94560	One is the first one, which you've already covered, which was a surprise.
94560	98520	We've had lots of elections this year, but this one wasn't expected, first of all.
98520	103160	Secondly, the outcome of this election looks quite uncertain and markets hate uncertain.
103160	105080	So I think that's important as well.
105080	110040	But probably thirdly and most importantly, the debt situation in France is pretty worrisome
110040	115320	and debt to GDP ratio of over 110% and quite a large deficit as well.
115320	118400	And the concern is that you will see more fiscal slippage.
118400	121960	You will not get a coordinated government that will bring that deficit and debt level
121960	122960	down over time.
122960	124260	So that's a big concern.
124260	129360	And then finally, with my equity hat on, I would say that some of the policies, particularly
129360	133720	the far left and the far right parties in France, would hit company earnings.
133720	136700	Discussions of things like, say, potential windfall taxes, for example.
136700	141180	So there are lots of reasons and really, though, the market hates uncertainty.
141180	145660	And is there an election outcome that the markets are most concerned about?
145660	149500	I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to
149500	155160	price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.
155160	159820	The one that they would like most of all, I believe, is the status quo we've currently
159820	160820	got.
160820	165740	The current sort of government is planning to reduce the deficit in France.
165780	169540	And we did have eventually debt to GDP in France peaking and coming down.
169540	175580	The other potential outcomes that we might get, for example, a minority far right government
175580	181740	or a majority far right government, either of those are much less likely to bring down
181740	183920	that debt ratio in France.
183920	188140	So there isn't really an outcome that markets are looking at that says, yeah, this is much
188140	189780	better than we expected.
189780	194580	And I think even the outcome that we do get over the next few weeks, if it's a minority
194620	199340	government or no coalition is formed, you might have further elections only a few months
199340	200340	away.
200340	203620	So again, that adds an extra layer of uncertainty for markets.
203620	208340	In the volatility that we've observed so far, which assets have moved the most?
208340	212620	So if I look, and again, I'm going to focus on equities here, and George can talk a bit
212620	213620	more about rates.
213620	218780	But if I look at the French equity market overall, the gains that we saw this year were
218780	222100	wiped out, really in very little time.
222140	226660	We've seen double digit falls for things like the French small cap indices, domestic stocks
226660	231500	in France, banks, and we've also seen sharp falls of infrastructure companies, which tend
231500	233740	to be quite defensive stocks in France too.
233740	238300	I mean, European equities, they have had a bit of a setback and particularly relative
238300	239300	to the S&P.
239300	244300	So if I look relative to the S&P 500, the stock 600, which is a broad measure of the
244300	249620	European market, that's down 5% relative to the US market in the last couple of weeks.
249620	252460	The impact on global equities though has been quite tiny.
252460	258340	So I do think this is seen as more a French issue first, and then a European issue second.
258340	263100	Well, as you said, though, the European equities have been hit a bit.
263100	267820	Do you think the markets broadly are overreacting when you think about the moves we've seen
267820	271540	in European equities and then even in French equities?
271540	275340	Yeah, it's a good question, given that the moves that we've had.
275340	280060	So for the CAC40 companies, which is the blue tip index in France, the actual exposure
280060	283380	to France in terms of sales for those stocks is quite small.
283380	285820	It's about 15% of their sales exposure.
285820	290180	I sometimes think it works better to flip it the other way around and think that 85%
290180	293600	of these companies' exposures is outside of France itself.
293600	298860	So arguably the moves, which we've seen year to date, wiping out the progress that the
298860	303700	CAC40 had made, does seem quite harsh relative to the fact this is a very international index.
303700	307540	But that being said, I do think the uncertainty is extremely high.
307540	308840	Investors are nervous.
308840	313460	And the CAC40 had been a good performer in recent years with a relatively high valuation.
313460	317600	So given all of that, I don't think the market move is all that extreme.
317600	321300	I think there's been pockets that might have been a bit extreme relative to, say, direct
321300	322500	earnings impact.
322500	326700	But given the sort of higher risk premium that we now have, I'm not surprised to see
326700	328180	this type of move.
328180	329180	Interesting.
329180	334340	And George, if we look at the bond market, French 10-year government bond yields have
334340	340240	surged relative to German bonds to the widest levels we've seen in recent years.
340240	344400	So what are the markets, the bond markets telling us about this situation?
344400	350920	We do know that the European bond markets price in relative credit worthiness via these
350920	351920	credit spreads.
351920	356980	So the level of yields typically benchmarked against the strongest credit, Germany, give
356980	362420	you some sense about the market's concern about the ability to finance future debt,
362420	365620	confidence in future fiscal trajectories, and so on.
365620	367460	And they move around with the fundamentals.
367460	372460	So if growth is weaker or government plans to spend more, you typically find these credit
372460	373460	spreads widening.
373460	378140	Now, what we've seen is about a 30 basis point, maybe depending on the day, maybe slightly
378140	381980	more credit spread widening between France and Germany.
381980	386700	That sounds maybe small relative to the sort of credit spread widening we've seen in other
386900	389760	European markets over the several years.
389760	392060	But this really is quite a big move for France.
392060	397540	It's akin to the move we saw ahead of the 2017 French presidential election, which again
397540	399720	was a fairly notable widening.
399720	404740	And so what it is really telling us is that the market is concerned that ultimately either
404740	411340	because of a general rise in the level of uncertainty about any future government's
411340	418260	capacity to improve the fiscal path or the possibility of electoral outcomes where you
418260	424940	have significant spending that is on top of the current fiscal trajectory, which as Sharon
424940	428900	mentioned is already a source of some concern for markets.
428900	432620	That really has left us in a fairly net negative position.
432620	439420	We either learn that spreads probably struggle to recover the levels we saw before the European
439420	446220	simply because the outcome worsens for the French president Macron, even in perhaps a
446220	451500	situation of a hung parliament, for example, if he had a diminished relative majority.
451500	455620	Or we learn that actually a government comes in with a more expansionary fiscal program.
455620	457740	And so the market is wrestling with that risk.
457740	462960	It's also interesting to note we've seen a bid for German bonds.
462960	465940	And so it's not just been a rise in French yields.
465980	470340	What we've also seen is that spread has widened because German yields have fallen.
470340	475340	And although French yields have been creeping back up, that actually tempers the overall
475340	480940	yield move for French bonds because ultimately the credit spread can widen not only because
480940	486040	French yields go up, but German yields go down and actually insulate the overall level
486040	487840	of yields in France.
487840	493400	And George, you said that there's actually a bid for German bonds, flight to safety, I assume.
493400	500760	Are there other assets that are particularly vulnerable or going to benefit in the bond market?
500760	505480	Yeah, well, I think that this is really the key thing that we are looking out for is the
505480	512900	extent to which stresses or repricing of credit spreads in France spills over into other markets.
512900	519600	We've seen in previous episodes, of course, you know, generalized spread moves in Europe,
519600	523220	for example, think about Italy and Spain and Portugal.
523220	528540	When you see, you know, a weakening of credit spread in one market, you often find that
528540	530680	there are spillovers to the other markets.
530680	535020	And so that is a key thing that the market is, you know, really got its eye on.
535020	539740	The world does look a little bit different to where we were perhaps a decade or so ago.
539740	546860	We now have additional measures, for example, at the ECB or the EU wide level that reduce
546860	547940	tail risk.
547940	553400	The ECB has its transmission protection instrument, which is a kind of backstop facility to buy
553400	555860	bonds if stresses emerge.
555860	561720	We know that at the EU level, there are additional fiscal pooling measures through the recovery
561720	564280	fund that supports Southern European economies.
564280	568880	And so in that sense, we perhaps don't have the same vulnerabilities as in the past.
568880	575880	However, we do have a situation where if there is a substantial challenge to, you know, fiscal
575900	582420	discipline coming out of the next French government, there is maybe the potential for that to have
582420	584400	knock on effects to other economies.
584400	589360	So what we are noticing is that although we are looking at the move in French bonds as
589360	596000	probably being reasonably large, given the potential for the next government to undertake
596000	601740	an expansionary fiscal plan, it does look like the market is still quite calm about
601740	604100	the implications for other economies.
604100	607860	It's not clear that that is wrong, but it's also something that makes us a little bit
607860	612680	wary about stepping in, for example, to buy these other markets just here.
612680	613680	Right.
613680	618220	So it's not clear that the market is right, is I think what I'm hearing you say.
618220	623080	But if we take a step back for a moment, I recall heading into this year, there was so
623080	629420	much focus on how expensive the U.S. market had gotten after a period of U.S. exceptionalism
629420	637420	for several years and growing optimism that the investment flows into the U.S. would start
637420	642140	to redirect towards areas elsewhere, such as Europe.
642140	647580	Has this ongoing political uncertainty in a core member like France upended that narrative?
647580	650800	Yeah, this is a great question and a real problem for Europe.
650800	654980	If we go about the clock about a month ago, I think the main conversation I was having
654980	660620	with global investors was the concern that, although yes, absolutely, the U.S. has got
660620	664780	its exceptionalism, you're already well pricing that in the case of the U.S.
664780	670140	So the S&P was very expensive and the MAG7 in the U.S. are such a dominant part of the
670140	673580	index, you're very concentrated in your exposure if you're investing in the U.S.
673580	676860	So there was a kind of view that, well, maybe we should look at Europe.
676860	680180	And they looked at Europe and they found that activity was improving, interest rates were
680180	684820	coming down in front of the Fed, very helpful, and that valuations were a lot lower.
684820	688820	And although the European equity market is quite concentrated too, it's not as concentrated
688820	691860	as in the U.S. and not in just that one sector either.
691860	697540	So tick, tick, tick, you've found that Europe offered some value and some cyclical improvement.
697540	702460	I still think it does, but I think this is obviously added to uncertainty.
702460	706060	And really, if I look at investment flows in Europe, in the last two years, we have
706060	710420	had constant outflows from global investors into Europe.
710460	715220	Really, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, we've seen those consistent outflows.
715220	719620	And they were starting to come back in, as I said, in that month or so, you were starting
719620	723540	to see investors interest in Europe for those elements I mentioned before.
723540	728220	But this really has shone a light, I would say, on the structural problems Europe has.
728220	731380	So the structural problems were always there, but you were willing to overlook them for
731380	733360	the cyclical upside I just mentioned.
733360	738140	The structural problems being a lack of growth, lack of productivity, lack of investment,
738180	741180	all of that I would put under the label of lack of growth.
741180	744440	And then the debt level that's already accumulated in Europe.
744440	749660	So those two problems, and I think those structural issues, which are very difficult to resolve,
749660	753300	this French election has really shone a light on those particular problematic issues.
753300	759820	And if we do see the outcome that the market fears, a far-right majority taking hold of
759820	763740	the government, and we see the fiscal expansion that the market is concerned about, that's
763740	765300	ultimately inflationary.
765300	770380	In which case, will that complicate the monetary policy mission going forward?
770380	771380	Yeah.
771380	777180	So I think this is the really interesting issue for the European economies.
777180	783460	It can be very challenging to undertake a unilateral fiscal expansion that actually
783460	787300	does have the impact on growth and inflation that you want, right?
787300	790180	That you want this to be better for growth.
790180	792940	The reason is that credit spread.
792940	798780	Because if that credit spread widens enough, then actually this is detrimental to growth.
798780	804060	We've got a situation where the market is worried about fiscal risks, and the net impact
804060	806180	for the economy may not be positive.
806180	811720	It may be that ultimately credit spreads or absolute yield levels rise so much that actually
811720	814300	it has a contractionary effect on the economy.
814300	817100	Again, that may be not quite where we are.
817100	820420	However, that I think is the really important thing to remember.
820420	826020	The growth benefits from looser fiscal policy can be taken back by that widening in the
826020	827020	credit spread.
827020	833440	And that's why I think ultimately the ECB will be very, very focused on transmission.
833440	837340	Because ultimately, you're right, inflation is too high.
837340	845960	And if you were to see, for example, a cooperative, coordinated fiscal expansion at the EU level
845960	850720	or the area-wide level, that would be much more inflationary.
850720	857440	But if you saw one country unilaterally attempting to undertake a big fiscal expansion, that
857440	862320	actually could have the opposite effect if the financial conditions tightening via wider
862320	865280	spreads, undoes the impact of that better growth.
865280	870760	So I think it's a little more complicated than to say the impact would be net inflationary,
870760	875280	because ultimately the market will give you a signal about whether or not that fiscal
875280	877040	policy is tenable.
877040	883760	I think for that reason, it does suggest that the incentive for any incoming government,
883760	889500	even the absolute majority of National Rally, would be to moderate the fiscal program compared
889500	895240	to a situation that would see a very significant and negative market reaction.
895240	900320	But again, the market obviously has widened because it just doesn't know what is likely
900320	901320	to come next.
901360	905600	I think that's such a good point as well, because we've had some incarnations of populist
905600	910400	governments in the last few years that didn't turn out to be as negative for markets as
910400	912200	perhaps investors feared beforehand.
912200	917600	And of course, that is an upside risk here that you do see a majority or even a minority
917600	922880	government which is National Rally, and yet they're perhaps not as extreme in their policies
922880	925080	as many investors worry about.
925080	926080	Interesting.
926200	933080	Let's turn to the UK election on July 4th, where the outcome seems potentially more certain
933080	936360	and markets have reacted less strongly.
936360	938440	Sharon, what issues are at stake there?
938440	942440	Yeah, so for equities, the UK election I would say is less worrisome.
942440	945360	And I think less worrisome than what we've been talking about with respect to France
945360	946900	in two senses.
946900	951760	First of all, the polling data is pointing to a clear lead for the Labour Party.
951760	953980	So the outcome feels a lot less uncertain.
953980	959020	And the second is that the space for being radical on policy is much more limited as
959020	963940	both of the main parties in the UK, the current government under the Conservative Party, or
963940	967540	the Labour Party that is in the lead in the polls, both of them are promising to keep
967540	970260	within quite tight fiscal rules.
970260	974980	And given that, there isn't a lot of space for huge surprises of the nature that will
974980	977520	potentially spook the markets.
977520	979860	So I see it as much less of a risk event.
979860	981220	George, do you agree?
981260	986140	Yeah, I mean, I think that when we look at the macro implications for the various plausible
986140	991380	outcomes under the current party plans, we really don't get a particularly widespread
991380	994300	on things like growth, inflation, the deficit.
994300	996500	It's not as if there are no differences.
996500	1002480	And perhaps you could imagine the market thinking and trying to price and understand, for example,
1002480	1004640	differences in the composition of the deficit.
1004640	1007980	Is it more taxation, more spending, or is it less on both?
1007980	1014060	Is the margin of the governing majority going to have some impact on the way that the market
1014060	1015060	reacts?
1015060	1019200	All of that is possible, but I think that's kind of second order to the point that Sharon
1019200	1025260	made that ultimately, it feels like the overall uncertainty around this election, not just
1025260	1031120	for the outcome itself, but the implications for macroeconomic policy on the far side is
1031120	1033220	likely to be a bit smaller this time.
1033220	1037840	But it always seems like as soon as we get comfortable about the amount of uncertainty
1037840	1041620	and assume something will be more certain, we're surprised.
1041620	1045620	And political uncertainty has, of course, been a key feature of the UK.
1045620	1050260	I'm thinking back to the 2022 LDI crisis, Brexit.
1050260	1056140	Still, maybe that was a moment where we expected some volatility and tremendous amount of uncertainty,
1056140	1058740	yet it was still somewhat of a shocker.
1058740	1066200	So are there any risks in the UK that are being mispriced or underestimated, George?
1066200	1067460	That's a really good question.
1067460	1073060	And I think that you're absolutely right in listing the events of the recent decade and
1073060	1079700	looking at the levels of uncertainty with a market pricing, you know, in terms of volatility
1079700	1084600	priced into markets, looking at the big shifts in asset pricing that we have seen.
1084600	1091200	Of course, that uncertainty has had huge impacts on UK markets, on sterling and on
1091200	1092920	the real economy itself.
1092920	1100700	I think in some sense, the freshness of the 2022 LDI crisis means I am more confident
1100700	1106840	to say that those risks have diminished simply because I do think, again, just having that
1106840	1113280	in the recent history itself constrains the kind of political possibilities in a way,
1113280	1118000	because the costs of that event were just so significant that ultimately it does push
1118000	1120880	toward more moderate policies.
1120880	1126220	And I think it has really made it clear that taking excessive fiscal risks is quite an
1126220	1127680	unwise thing to do.
1127680	1132040	Again, in the current moment when yields are high, inflation is high, the central banks,
1132040	1135440	you know, are finding it difficult to provide a lot of relief by cutting rates.
1135440	1139280	And so it's not to say, of course, that fiscal risks have disappeared.
1139280	1143480	They are still, of course, there for the UK, but it does look like, at least in terms
1143480	1147320	of the political consensus, it's moved to a much more moderate position.
1147320	1152400	Maybe I could mention one other thing, which is that we've very clearly seen the UK move
1152400	1157400	to a relatively hard form of Brexit, introducing a lot of friction with the trading relationship
1157400	1158400	with Europe.
1158400	1163020	I think it's interesting to consider the possibility that maybe that doesn't worsen from here and
1163020	1164920	in fact may even improve.
1164920	1169800	And so in a sense, could it be that the risk that is mispriced, could it be a positive
1169800	1170800	one?
1170800	1175140	I mean, that seems something that might seem a long shot and probably is a more long term
1175140	1178280	question for the UK given the current political reality.
1178280	1184100	But I think that the situation where the UK seeks to improve what has been a really poor
1184100	1189520	productivity performance by loosening the supply side of the economy, moving closer
1189520	1195400	to its nearest trading partner, not reversing Brexit necessarily, but maybe taking measures
1195400	1200560	to reduce trade frictions or enter into various reciprocal agreements.
1200560	1206440	And I would argue within equities that sort of upside risk, upside potential is not superpriced
1206440	1207440	either.
1207440	1213160	If I look at say, FTSE 100, the big cap index in the UK, it trades on roughly half the valuation
1213160	1217200	of the S&P and many would argue rightly so because it doesn't have the exposure to tech,
1217200	1219520	but it is one of the cheapest indices globally.
1219520	1224320	And if I look at say the FTSE 250, which is the mid cap index, which is much more UK exposed,
1224320	1229060	that is also trading on a similar valuation and it's close to the lows of its valuation
1229060	1230940	range in the last 20 years.
1230940	1235960	So this shows you the market's already pricing a lot of the weaker structural problems in
1235960	1240640	the UK and not so much of the potential upside risk that George talked about.
1240640	1246240	But it seems kind of ironic to me that just as the UK may be getting to a place where
1246280	1252420	it could start to strengthen its relationship with the euro area again, the euro area again
1252420	1254800	seems to be very much in question.
1254800	1260520	You know, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm hearing more and more concern about the fragmentation
1260520	1263880	of the euro area than I've heard in quite some time.
1263880	1269120	So as a leaving question, let me just ask you, what are you watching in terms of the
1269120	1272300	signs of growing risk in the euro area?
1272300	1277220	So very clearly, as I mentioned before, watching the credit spreads is a very clear way to
1277220	1282760	see is the market pricing this as a localised domestic issue for France or is it broadening
1282760	1289180	out and seeing spillovers into other sovereign markets and being priced as a more generalised,
1289180	1291600	if you like, systemic risk in Europe?
1291600	1293660	It's a reasonable question to ask.
1293660	1298900	You know, how can France have a serious issue, for example, around fiscal policy or credit
1298900	1303260	spreads without it being a European issue, just given how important France is to the
1303260	1305780	broader euro area and EU as a whole?
1305780	1308940	And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable point to make.
1308940	1316020	And so in a sense, I do think watching this relatively calm response that we've seen in
1316020	1319300	other sovereign bond markets is absolutely key.
1319300	1323940	To the extent that that begins to broaden out, it would be a sign that maybe the market
1323940	1329620	is starting to connect the dots and say that whether it's because of potential changes
1329620	1336320	to fiscal rules, whether it's because of potential implications for the 2027 presidential election
1336320	1341700	in France, there might be broader risks than just something you see on the French domestic
1341700	1342980	political front.
1342980	1348080	And then, of course, I do think for the broader economy, is this something that will be a
1348080	1349780	negative for French growth?
1349780	1354180	Will it be broader tightening in financial conditions that will weaken the economy?
1354180	1360520	Because what we do know is that euro area fragmentation risk, as you mentioned, we have
1360520	1364660	seen that that really comes to the fore when growth is particularly weak.
1364660	1369740	And at the moment, what we have seen is that there has been some signs of a cyclical upswing.
1369740	1374300	We know that the European consumer will benefit from lower inflation, lower energy prices.
1374300	1376300	That should be a tailwind to growth.
1376300	1380780	And if you were to see a financial conditions tightening, short circuit that and move the
1380780	1385340	euro area into a weaker period of growth, that, of course, increases those risks.
1385340	1391860	I would say that, again, and I think I mentioned earlier, the world is different post-pandemic.
1391860	1397800	We do have additional backstops in the euro area that curtail some of the fragmentation
1397800	1399300	risks that we've seen in the past.
1399300	1403740	Again, that might be one of the reasons why the market is a little more relaxed this time
1403740	1405900	beyond the French bond market.
1405900	1407500	But that, of course, bears close watching.
1407500	1412300	And I think what is clear is that we certainly haven't seen moves in sovereign bond markets
1412300	1416980	that would warrant some intervention with those backstops from the ECB.
1416980	1420940	That of course would be a lot further away in terms of spread widening.
1420940	1424540	So watch the outcome of the French election, of course.
1424540	1431480	Watch for any spillover risk into other regional bond markets and the economy more broadly.
1431480	1433340	And in the UK, let's see.
1433340	1438020	We'll see for another political surprise or if we and the markets are right that we're
1438020	1442820	going to have a more benign outcome and hopefully a bit more of a positive trajectory in terms
1442820	1446140	of the relationship between the UK and Europe.
1446140	1448220	And we'll see what it brings for the economy and markets.
1448220	1449220	Absolutely.
1449220	1452900	I think one thing I would say is just, you know, we're four for four for interesting
1452900	1454060	elections so far.
1454060	1458700	If you think across emerging markets, the EU election, which again threw up the surprise
1458700	1461700	of the French, and of course, we've got some big ones to come.
1461820	1463980	Sharon, George, thanks so much for joining us.
1463980	1464980	That's great.
1464980	1465980	Thank you.
