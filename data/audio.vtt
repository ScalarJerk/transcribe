00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
In the year of elections, two of Europe's three largest economies are heading to the

00:04.040 --> 00:07.840
polls and investors' reactions couldn't be any more different.

00:07.840 --> 00:12.880
France's upcoming parliamentary elections are wreaking havoc on French stocks and bonds,

00:12.880 --> 00:17.720
while UK financial markets have been relatively stable as the country gears up for its own

00:17.720 --> 00:19.800
general election on July 4.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.200
So what are the markets telling us about the political landscape, and are there risks that

00:24.200 --> 00:25.560
are being mispriced?

00:25.560 --> 00:29.400
I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to

00:29.400 --> 00:35.280
price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.280
I'm Alison Nathan and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges.

00:46.720 --> 00:50.760
For today's episode, I'm sitting down with my colleagues in Goldman Sachs Research.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.160
Sharon Bell is a senior strategist on the European Portfolio Strategy team and George

00:55.160 --> 00:59.960
Cole is the head of European Rate Strategy in the Global Macro and Markets Research Group.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.200
They're both joining me remotely from London.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.360
Sharon, George, welcome back to the program.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
Great to see you all.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.360
Thank you.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.360
Thanks very much.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.840
So let's start with the French elections.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.840
The snap election called by French President Emmanuel Macron, which will take place on

01:13.840 --> 01:18.560
June 30 with a second round on July 7, was no doubt a surprise.

01:18.560 --> 01:23.800
And I'm not saying it wasn't, but it sent French assets into an absolute tailspin.

01:23.880 --> 01:26.560
Sharon, why do the markets react so strongly?

01:26.560 --> 01:28.680
You know, I think that there are lots of reasons.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.760
I mean, I probably put them down into four different buckets.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.560
One is the first one, which you've already covered, which was a surprise.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.520
We've had lots of elections this year, but this one wasn't expected, first of all.

01:38.520 --> 01:43.160
Secondly, the outcome of this election looks quite uncertain and markets hate uncertain.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.080
So I think that's important as well.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.040
But probably thirdly and most importantly, the debt situation in France is pretty worrisome

01:50.040 --> 01:55.320
and debt to GDP ratio of over 110% and quite a large deficit as well.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.400
And the concern is that you will see more fiscal slippage.

01:58.400 --> 02:01.960
You will not get a coordinated government that will bring that deficit and debt level

02:01.960 --> 02:02.960
down over time.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.260
So that's a big concern.

02:04.260 --> 02:09.360
And then finally, with my equity hat on, I would say that some of the policies, particularly

02:09.360 --> 02:13.720
the far left and the far right parties in France, would hit company earnings.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.700
Discussions of things like, say, potential windfall taxes, for example.

02:16.700 --> 02:21.180
So there are lots of reasons and really, though, the market hates uncertainty.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.660
And is there an election outcome that the markets are most concerned about?

02:25.660 --> 02:29.500
I think the problem with this and the reason that markets are finding it so difficult to

02:29.500 --> 02:35.160
price is that there's not a clear path to a great outcome for markets.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.820
The one that they would like most of all, I believe, is the status quo we've currently

02:39.820 --> 02:40.820
got.

02:40.820 --> 02:45.740
The current sort of government is planning to reduce the deficit in France.

02:45.780 --> 02:49.540
And we did have eventually debt to GDP in France peaking and coming down.

02:49.540 --> 02:55.580
The other potential outcomes that we might get, for example, a minority far right government

02:55.580 --> 03:01.740
or a majority far right government, either of those are much less likely to bring down

03:01.740 --> 03:03.920
that debt ratio in France.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.140
So there isn't really an outcome that markets are looking at that says, yeah, this is much

03:08.140 --> 03:09.780
better than we expected.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.580
And I think even the outcome that we do get over the next few weeks, if it's a minority

03:14.620 --> 03:19.340
government or no coalition is formed, you might have further elections only a few months

03:19.340 --> 03:20.340
away.

03:20.340 --> 03:23.620
So again, that adds an extra layer of uncertainty for markets.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.340
In the volatility that we've observed so far, which assets have moved the most?

03:28.340 --> 03:32.620
So if I look, and again, I'm going to focus on equities here, and George can talk a bit

03:32.620 --> 03:33.620
more about rates.

03:33.620 --> 03:38.780
But if I look at the French equity market overall, the gains that we saw this year were

03:38.780 --> 03:42.100
wiped out, really in very little time.

03:42.140 --> 03:46.660
We've seen double digit falls for things like the French small cap indices, domestic stocks

03:46.660 --> 03:51.500
in France, banks, and we've also seen sharp falls of infrastructure companies, which tend

03:51.500 --> 03:53.740
to be quite defensive stocks in France too.

03:53.740 --> 03:58.300
I mean, European equities, they have had a bit of a setback and particularly relative

03:58.300 --> 03:59.300
to the S&P.

03:59.300 --> 04:04.300
So if I look relative to the S&P 500, the stock 600, which is a broad measure of the

04:04.300 --> 04:09.620
European market, that's down 5% relative to the US market in the last couple of weeks.

04:09.620 --> 04:12.460
The impact on global equities though has been quite tiny.

04:12.460 --> 04:18.340
So I do think this is seen as more a French issue first, and then a European issue second.

04:18.340 --> 04:23.100
Well, as you said, though, the European equities have been hit a bit.

04:23.100 --> 04:27.820
Do you think the markets broadly are overreacting when you think about the moves we've seen

04:27.820 --> 04:31.540
in European equities and then even in French equities?

04:31.540 --> 04:35.340
Yeah, it's a good question, given that the moves that we've had.

04:35.340 --> 04:40.060
So for the CAC40 companies, which is the blue tip index in France, the actual exposure

04:40.060 --> 04:43.380
to France in terms of sales for those stocks is quite small.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.820
It's about 15% of their sales exposure.

04:45.820 --> 04:50.180
I sometimes think it works better to flip it the other way around and think that 85%

04:50.180 --> 04:53.600
of these companies' exposures is outside of France itself.

04:53.600 --> 04:58.860
So arguably the moves, which we've seen year to date, wiping out the progress that the

04:58.860 --> 05:03.700
CAC40 had made, does seem quite harsh relative to the fact this is a very international index.

05:03.700 --> 05:07.540
But that being said, I do think the uncertainty is extremely high.

05:07.540 --> 05:08.840
Investors are nervous.

05:08.840 --> 05:13.460
And the CAC40 had been a good performer in recent years with a relatively high valuation.

05:13.460 --> 05:17.600
So given all of that, I don't think the market move is all that extreme.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.300
I think there's been pockets that might have been a bit extreme relative to, say, direct

05:21.300 --> 05:22.500
earnings impact.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.700
But given the sort of higher risk premium that we now have, I'm not surprised to see

05:26.700 --> 05:28.180
this type of move.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.180
Interesting.

05:29.180 --> 05:34.340
And George, if we look at the bond market, French 10-year government bond yields have

05:34.340 --> 05:40.240
surged relative to German bonds to the widest levels we've seen in recent years.

05:40.240 --> 05:44.400
So what are the markets, the bond markets telling us about this situation?

05:44.400 --> 05:50.920
We do know that the European bond markets price in relative credit worthiness via these

05:50.920 --> 05:51.920
credit spreads.

05:51.920 --> 05:56.980
So the level of yields typically benchmarked against the strongest credit, Germany, give

05:56.980 --> 06:02.420
you some sense about the market's concern about the ability to finance future debt,

06:02.420 --> 06:05.620
confidence in future fiscal trajectories, and so on.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.460
And they move around with the fundamentals.

06:07.460 --> 06:12.460
So if growth is weaker or government plans to spend more, you typically find these credit

06:12.460 --> 06:13.460
spreads widening.

06:13.460 --> 06:18.140
Now, what we've seen is about a 30 basis point, maybe depending on the day, maybe slightly

06:18.140 --> 06:21.980
more credit spread widening between France and Germany.

06:21.980 --> 06:26.700
That sounds maybe small relative to the sort of credit spread widening we've seen in other

06:26.900 --> 06:29.760
European markets over the several years.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.060
But this really is quite a big move for France.

06:32.060 --> 06:37.540
It's akin to the move we saw ahead of the 2017 French presidential election, which again

06:37.540 --> 06:39.720
was a fairly notable widening.

06:39.720 --> 06:44.740
And so what it is really telling us is that the market is concerned that ultimately either

06:44.740 --> 06:51.340
because of a general rise in the level of uncertainty about any future government's

06:51.340 --> 06:58.260
capacity to improve the fiscal path or the possibility of electoral outcomes where you

06:58.260 --> 07:04.940
have significant spending that is on top of the current fiscal trajectory, which as Sharon

07:04.940 --> 07:08.900
mentioned is already a source of some concern for markets.

07:08.900 --> 07:12.620
That really has left us in a fairly net negative position.

07:12.620 --> 07:19.420
We either learn that spreads probably struggle to recover the levels we saw before the European

07:19.420 --> 07:26.220
simply because the outcome worsens for the French president Macron, even in perhaps a

07:26.220 --> 07:31.500
situation of a hung parliament, for example, if he had a diminished relative majority.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.620
Or we learn that actually a government comes in with a more expansionary fiscal program.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.740
And so the market is wrestling with that risk.

07:37.740 --> 07:42.960
It's also interesting to note we've seen a bid for German bonds.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.940
And so it's not just been a rise in French yields.

07:45.980 --> 07:50.340
What we've also seen is that spread has widened because German yields have fallen.

07:50.340 --> 07:55.340
And although French yields have been creeping back up, that actually tempers the overall

07:55.340 --> 08:00.940
yield move for French bonds because ultimately the credit spread can widen not only because

08:00.940 --> 08:06.040
French yields go up, but German yields go down and actually insulate the overall level

08:06.040 --> 08:07.840
of yields in France.

08:07.840 --> 08:13.400
And George, you said that there's actually a bid for German bonds, flight to safety, I assume.

08:13.400 --> 08:20.760
Are there other assets that are particularly vulnerable or going to benefit in the bond market?

08:20.760 --> 08:25.480
Yeah, well, I think that this is really the key thing that we are looking out for is the

08:25.480 --> 08:32.900
extent to which stresses or repricing of credit spreads in France spills over into other markets.

08:32.900 --> 08:39.600
We've seen in previous episodes, of course, you know, generalized spread moves in Europe,

08:39.600 --> 08:43.220
for example, think about Italy and Spain and Portugal.

08:43.220 --> 08:48.540
When you see, you know, a weakening of credit spread in one market, you often find that

08:48.540 --> 08:50.680
there are spillovers to the other markets.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.020
And so that is a key thing that the market is, you know, really got its eye on.

08:55.020 --> 08:59.740
The world does look a little bit different to where we were perhaps a decade or so ago.

08:59.740 --> 09:06.860
We now have additional measures, for example, at the ECB or the EU wide level that reduce

09:06.860 --> 09:07.940
tail risk.

09:07.940 --> 09:13.400
The ECB has its transmission protection instrument, which is a kind of backstop facility to buy

09:13.400 --> 09:15.860
bonds if stresses emerge.

09:15.860 --> 09:21.720
We know that at the EU level, there are additional fiscal pooling measures through the recovery

09:21.720 --> 09:24.280
fund that supports Southern European economies.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.880
And so in that sense, we perhaps don't have the same vulnerabilities as in the past.

09:28.880 --> 09:35.880
However, we do have a situation where if there is a substantial challenge to, you know, fiscal

09:35.900 --> 09:42.420
discipline coming out of the next French government, there is maybe the potential for that to have

09:42.420 --> 09:44.400
knock on effects to other economies.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.360
So what we are noticing is that although we are looking at the move in French bonds as

09:49.360 --> 09:56.000
probably being reasonably large, given the potential for the next government to undertake

09:56.000 --> 10:01.740
an expansionary fiscal plan, it does look like the market is still quite calm about

10:01.740 --> 10:04.100
the implications for other economies.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.860
It's not clear that that is wrong, but it's also something that makes us a little bit

10:07.860 --> 10:12.680
wary about stepping in, for example, to buy these other markets just here.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.680
Right.

10:13.680 --> 10:18.220
So it's not clear that the market is right, is I think what I'm hearing you say.

10:18.220 --> 10:23.080
But if we take a step back for a moment, I recall heading into this year, there was so

10:23.080 --> 10:29.420
much focus on how expensive the U.S. market had gotten after a period of U.S. exceptionalism

10:29.420 --> 10:37.420
for several years and growing optimism that the investment flows into the U.S. would start

10:37.420 --> 10:42.140
to redirect towards areas elsewhere, such as Europe.

10:42.140 --> 10:47.580
Has this ongoing political uncertainty in a core member like France upended that narrative?

10:47.580 --> 10:50.800
Yeah, this is a great question and a real problem for Europe.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.980
If we go about the clock about a month ago, I think the main conversation I was having

10:54.980 --> 11:00.620
with global investors was the concern that, although yes, absolutely, the U.S. has got

11:00.620 --> 11:04.780
its exceptionalism, you're already well pricing that in the case of the U.S.

11:04.780 --> 11:10.140
So the S&P was very expensive and the MAG7 in the U.S. are such a dominant part of the

11:10.140 --> 11:13.580
index, you're very concentrated in your exposure if you're investing in the U.S.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.860
So there was a kind of view that, well, maybe we should look at Europe.

11:16.860 --> 11:20.180
And they looked at Europe and they found that activity was improving, interest rates were

11:20.180 --> 11:24.820
coming down in front of the Fed, very helpful, and that valuations were a lot lower.

11:24.820 --> 11:28.820
And although the European equity market is quite concentrated too, it's not as concentrated

11:28.820 --> 11:31.860
as in the U.S. and not in just that one sector either.

11:31.860 --> 11:37.540
So tick, tick, tick, you've found that Europe offered some value and some cyclical improvement.

11:37.540 --> 11:42.460
I still think it does, but I think this is obviously added to uncertainty.

11:42.460 --> 11:46.060
And really, if I look at investment flows in Europe, in the last two years, we have

11:46.060 --> 11:50.420
had constant outflows from global investors into Europe.

11:50.460 --> 11:55.220
Really, ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, we've seen those consistent outflows.

11:55.220 --> 11:59.620
And they were starting to come back in, as I said, in that month or so, you were starting

11:59.620 --> 12:03.540
to see investors interest in Europe for those elements I mentioned before.

12:03.540 --> 12:08.220
But this really has shone a light, I would say, on the structural problems Europe has.

12:08.220 --> 12:11.380
So the structural problems were always there, but you were willing to overlook them for

12:11.380 --> 12:13.360
the cyclical upside I just mentioned.

12:13.360 --> 12:18.140
The structural problems being a lack of growth, lack of productivity, lack of investment,

12:18.180 --> 12:21.180
all of that I would put under the label of lack of growth.

12:21.180 --> 12:24.440
And then the debt level that's already accumulated in Europe.

12:24.440 --> 12:29.660
So those two problems, and I think those structural issues, which are very difficult to resolve,

12:29.660 --> 12:33.300
this French election has really shone a light on those particular problematic issues.

12:33.300 --> 12:39.820
And if we do see the outcome that the market fears, a far-right majority taking hold of

12:39.820 --> 12:43.740
the government, and we see the fiscal expansion that the market is concerned about, that's

12:43.740 --> 12:45.300
ultimately inflationary.

12:45.300 --> 12:50.380
In which case, will that complicate the monetary policy mission going forward?

12:50.380 --> 12:51.380
Yeah.

12:51.380 --> 12:57.180
So I think this is the really interesting issue for the European economies.

12:57.180 --> 13:03.460
It can be very challenging to undertake a unilateral fiscal expansion that actually

13:03.460 --> 13:07.300
does have the impact on growth and inflation that you want, right?

13:07.300 --> 13:10.180
That you want this to be better for growth.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.940
The reason is that credit spread.

13:12.940 --> 13:18.780
Because if that credit spread widens enough, then actually this is detrimental to growth.

13:18.780 --> 13:24.060
We've got a situation where the market is worried about fiscal risks, and the net impact

13:24.060 --> 13:26.180
for the economy may not be positive.

13:26.180 --> 13:31.720
It may be that ultimately credit spreads or absolute yield levels rise so much that actually

13:31.720 --> 13:34.300
it has a contractionary effect on the economy.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.100
Again, that may be not quite where we are.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.420
However, that I think is the really important thing to remember.

13:40.420 --> 13:46.020
The growth benefits from looser fiscal policy can be taken back by that widening in the

13:46.020 --> 13:47.020
credit spread.

13:47.020 --> 13:53.440
And that's why I think ultimately the ECB will be very, very focused on transmission.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.340
Because ultimately, you're right, inflation is too high.

13:57.340 --> 14:05.960
And if you were to see, for example, a cooperative, coordinated fiscal expansion at the EU level

14:05.960 --> 14:10.720
or the area-wide level, that would be much more inflationary.

14:10.720 --> 14:17.440
But if you saw one country unilaterally attempting to undertake a big fiscal expansion, that

14:17.440 --> 14:22.320
actually could have the opposite effect if the financial conditions tightening via wider

14:22.320 --> 14:25.280
spreads, undoes the impact of that better growth.

14:25.280 --> 14:30.760
So I think it's a little more complicated than to say the impact would be net inflationary,

14:30.760 --> 14:35.280
because ultimately the market will give you a signal about whether or not that fiscal

14:35.280 --> 14:37.040
policy is tenable.

14:37.040 --> 14:43.760
I think for that reason, it does suggest that the incentive for any incoming government,

14:43.760 --> 14:49.500
even the absolute majority of National Rally, would be to moderate the fiscal program compared

14:49.500 --> 14:55.240
to a situation that would see a very significant and negative market reaction.

14:55.240 --> 15:00.320
But again, the market obviously has widened because it just doesn't know what is likely

15:00.320 --> 15:01.320
to come next.

15:01.360 --> 15:05.600
I think that's such a good point as well, because we've had some incarnations of populist

15:05.600 --> 15:10.400
governments in the last few years that didn't turn out to be as negative for markets as

15:10.400 --> 15:12.200
perhaps investors feared beforehand.

15:12.200 --> 15:17.600
And of course, that is an upside risk here that you do see a majority or even a minority

15:17.600 --> 15:22.880
government which is National Rally, and yet they're perhaps not as extreme in their policies

15:22.880 --> 15:25.080
as many investors worry about.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
Interesting.

15:26.200 --> 15:33.080
Let's turn to the UK election on July 4th, where the outcome seems potentially more certain

15:33.080 --> 15:36.360
and markets have reacted less strongly.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.440
Sharon, what issues are at stake there?

15:38.440 --> 15:42.440
Yeah, so for equities, the UK election I would say is less worrisome.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.360
And I think less worrisome than what we've been talking about with respect to France

15:45.360 --> 15:46.900
in two senses.

15:46.900 --> 15:51.760
First of all, the polling data is pointing to a clear lead for the Labour Party.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.980
So the outcome feels a lot less uncertain.

15:53.980 --> 15:59.020
And the second is that the space for being radical on policy is much more limited as

15:59.020 --> 16:03.940
both of the main parties in the UK, the current government under the Conservative Party, or

16:03.940 --> 16:07.540
the Labour Party that is in the lead in the polls, both of them are promising to keep

16:07.540 --> 16:10.260
within quite tight fiscal rules.

16:10.260 --> 16:14.980
And given that, there isn't a lot of space for huge surprises of the nature that will

16:14.980 --> 16:17.520
potentially spook the markets.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.860
So I see it as much less of a risk event.

16:19.860 --> 16:21.220
George, do you agree?

16:21.260 --> 16:26.140
Yeah, I mean, I think that when we look at the macro implications for the various plausible

16:26.140 --> 16:31.380
outcomes under the current party plans, we really don't get a particularly widespread

16:31.380 --> 16:34.300
on things like growth, inflation, the deficit.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.500
It's not as if there are no differences.

16:36.500 --> 16:42.480
And perhaps you could imagine the market thinking and trying to price and understand, for example,

16:42.480 --> 16:44.640
differences in the composition of the deficit.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.980
Is it more taxation, more spending, or is it less on both?

16:47.980 --> 16:54.060
Is the margin of the governing majority going to have some impact on the way that the market

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
reacts?

16:55.060 --> 16:59.200
All of that is possible, but I think that's kind of second order to the point that Sharon

16:59.200 --> 17:05.260
made that ultimately, it feels like the overall uncertainty around this election, not just

17:05.260 --> 17:11.120
for the outcome itself, but the implications for macroeconomic policy on the far side is

17:11.120 --> 17:13.220
likely to be a bit smaller this time.

17:13.220 --> 17:17.840
But it always seems like as soon as we get comfortable about the amount of uncertainty

17:17.840 --> 17:21.620
and assume something will be more certain, we're surprised.

17:21.620 --> 17:25.620
And political uncertainty has, of course, been a key feature of the UK.

17:25.620 --> 17:30.260
I'm thinking back to the 2022 LDI crisis, Brexit.

17:30.260 --> 17:36.140
Still, maybe that was a moment where we expected some volatility and tremendous amount of uncertainty,

17:36.140 --> 17:38.740
yet it was still somewhat of a shocker.

17:38.740 --> 17:46.200
So are there any risks in the UK that are being mispriced or underestimated, George?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.460
That's a really good question.

17:47.460 --> 17:53.060
And I think that you're absolutely right in listing the events of the recent decade and

17:53.060 --> 17:59.700
looking at the levels of uncertainty with a market pricing, you know, in terms of volatility

17:59.700 --> 18:04.600
priced into markets, looking at the big shifts in asset pricing that we have seen.

18:04.600 --> 18:11.200
Of course, that uncertainty has had huge impacts on UK markets, on sterling and on

18:11.200 --> 18:12.920
the real economy itself.

18:12.920 --> 18:20.700
I think in some sense, the freshness of the 2022 LDI crisis means I am more confident

18:20.700 --> 18:26.840
to say that those risks have diminished simply because I do think, again, just having that

18:26.840 --> 18:33.280
in the recent history itself constrains the kind of political possibilities in a way,

18:33.280 --> 18:38.000
because the costs of that event were just so significant that ultimately it does push

18:38.000 --> 18:40.880
toward more moderate policies.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.220
And I think it has really made it clear that taking excessive fiscal risks is quite an

18:46.220 --> 18:47.680
unwise thing to do.

18:47.680 --> 18:52.040
Again, in the current moment when yields are high, inflation is high, the central banks,

18:52.040 --> 18:55.440
you know, are finding it difficult to provide a lot of relief by cutting rates.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.280
And so it's not to say, of course, that fiscal risks have disappeared.

18:59.280 --> 19:03.480
They are still, of course, there for the UK, but it does look like, at least in terms

19:03.480 --> 19:07.320
of the political consensus, it's moved to a much more moderate position.

19:07.320 --> 19:12.400
Maybe I could mention one other thing, which is that we've very clearly seen the UK move

19:12.400 --> 19:17.400
to a relatively hard form of Brexit, introducing a lot of friction with the trading relationship

19:17.400 --> 19:18.400
with Europe.

19:18.400 --> 19:23.020
I think it's interesting to consider the possibility that maybe that doesn't worsen from here and

19:23.020 --> 19:24.920
in fact may even improve.

19:24.920 --> 19:29.800
And so in a sense, could it be that the risk that is mispriced, could it be a positive

19:29.800 --> 19:30.800
one?

19:30.800 --> 19:35.140
I mean, that seems something that might seem a long shot and probably is a more long term

19:35.140 --> 19:38.280
question for the UK given the current political reality.

19:38.280 --> 19:44.100
But I think that the situation where the UK seeks to improve what has been a really poor

19:44.100 --> 19:49.520
productivity performance by loosening the supply side of the economy, moving closer

19:49.520 --> 19:55.400
to its nearest trading partner, not reversing Brexit necessarily, but maybe taking measures

19:55.400 --> 20:00.560
to reduce trade frictions or enter into various reciprocal agreements.

20:00.560 --> 20:06.440
And I would argue within equities that sort of upside risk, upside potential is not superpriced

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
either.

20:07.440 --> 20:13.160
If I look at say, FTSE 100, the big cap index in the UK, it trades on roughly half the valuation

20:13.160 --> 20:17.200
of the S&P and many would argue rightly so because it doesn't have the exposure to tech,

20:17.200 --> 20:19.520
but it is one of the cheapest indices globally.

20:19.520 --> 20:24.320
And if I look at say the FTSE 250, which is the mid cap index, which is much more UK exposed,

20:24.320 --> 20:29.060
that is also trading on a similar valuation and it's close to the lows of its valuation

20:29.060 --> 20:30.940
range in the last 20 years.

20:30.940 --> 20:35.960
So this shows you the market's already pricing a lot of the weaker structural problems in

20:35.960 --> 20:40.640
the UK and not so much of the potential upside risk that George talked about.

20:40.640 --> 20:46.240
But it seems kind of ironic to me that just as the UK may be getting to a place where

20:46.280 --> 20:52.420
it could start to strengthen its relationship with the euro area again, the euro area again

20:52.420 --> 20:54.800
seems to be very much in question.

20:54.800 --> 21:00.520
You know, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm hearing more and more concern about the fragmentation

21:00.520 --> 21:03.880
of the euro area than I've heard in quite some time.

21:03.880 --> 21:09.120
So as a leaving question, let me just ask you, what are you watching in terms of the

21:09.120 --> 21:12.300
signs of growing risk in the euro area?

21:12.300 --> 21:17.220
So very clearly, as I mentioned before, watching the credit spreads is a very clear way to

21:17.220 --> 21:22.760
see is the market pricing this as a localised domestic issue for France or is it broadening

21:22.760 --> 21:29.180
out and seeing spillovers into other sovereign markets and being priced as a more generalised,

21:29.180 --> 21:31.600
if you like, systemic risk in Europe?

21:31.600 --> 21:33.660
It's a reasonable question to ask.

21:33.660 --> 21:38.900
You know, how can France have a serious issue, for example, around fiscal policy or credit

21:38.900 --> 21:43.260
spreads without it being a European issue, just given how important France is to the

21:43.260 --> 21:45.780
broader euro area and EU as a whole?

21:45.780 --> 21:48.940
And I think that that is a perfectly reasonable point to make.

21:48.940 --> 21:56.020
And so in a sense, I do think watching this relatively calm response that we've seen in

21:56.020 --> 21:59.300
other sovereign bond markets is absolutely key.

21:59.300 --> 22:03.940
To the extent that that begins to broaden out, it would be a sign that maybe the market

22:03.940 --> 22:09.620
is starting to connect the dots and say that whether it's because of potential changes

22:09.620 --> 22:16.320
to fiscal rules, whether it's because of potential implications for the 2027 presidential election

22:16.320 --> 22:21.700
in France, there might be broader risks than just something you see on the French domestic

22:21.700 --> 22:22.980
political front.

22:22.980 --> 22:28.080
And then, of course, I do think for the broader economy, is this something that will be a

22:28.080 --> 22:29.780
negative for French growth?

22:29.780 --> 22:34.180
Will it be broader tightening in financial conditions that will weaken the economy?

22:34.180 --> 22:40.520
Because what we do know is that euro area fragmentation risk, as you mentioned, we have

22:40.520 --> 22:44.660
seen that that really comes to the fore when growth is particularly weak.

22:44.660 --> 22:49.740
And at the moment, what we have seen is that there has been some signs of a cyclical upswing.

22:49.740 --> 22:54.300
We know that the European consumer will benefit from lower inflation, lower energy prices.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.300
That should be a tailwind to growth.

22:56.300 --> 23:00.780
And if you were to see a financial conditions tightening, short circuit that and move the

23:00.780 --> 23:05.340
euro area into a weaker period of growth, that, of course, increases those risks.

23:05.340 --> 23:11.860
I would say that, again, and I think I mentioned earlier, the world is different post-pandemic.

23:11.860 --> 23:17.800
We do have additional backstops in the euro area that curtail some of the fragmentation

23:17.800 --> 23:19.300
risks that we've seen in the past.

23:19.300 --> 23:23.740
Again, that might be one of the reasons why the market is a little more relaxed this time

23:23.740 --> 23:25.900
beyond the French bond market.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.500
But that, of course, bears close watching.

23:27.500 --> 23:32.300
And I think what is clear is that we certainly haven't seen moves in sovereign bond markets

23:32.300 --> 23:36.980
that would warrant some intervention with those backstops from the ECB.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.940
That of course would be a lot further away in terms of spread widening.

23:40.940 --> 23:44.540
So watch the outcome of the French election, of course.

23:44.540 --> 23:51.480
Watch for any spillover risk into other regional bond markets and the economy more broadly.

23:51.480 --> 23:53.340
And in the UK, let's see.

23:53.340 --> 23:58.020
We'll see for another political surprise or if we and the markets are right that we're

23:58.020 --> 24:02.820
going to have a more benign outcome and hopefully a bit more of a positive trajectory in terms

24:02.820 --> 24:06.140
of the relationship between the UK and Europe.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.220
And we'll see what it brings for the economy and markets.

24:08.220 --> 24:09.220
Absolutely.

24:09.220 --> 24:12.900
I think one thing I would say is just, you know, we're four for four for interesting

24:12.900 --> 24:14.060
elections so far.

24:14.060 --> 24:18.700
If you think across emerging markets, the EU election, which again threw up the surprise

24:18.700 --> 24:21.700
of the French, and of course, we've got some big ones to come.

24:21.820 --> 24:23.980
Sharon, George, thanks so much for joining us.

24:23.980 --> 24:24.980
That's great.

24:24.980 --> 24:25.980
Thank you.

24:25.980 --> 24:26.980
Thanks very much.
